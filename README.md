# Playground for procedural generators

This repository contains procedural generators for:
1. Pixel art:
   - Floor texture
   - ...
2. ...

Keep in mind that all the code in this repository was made with the idea of prototyping.
Hence, the code is dirty, not thoroughly tested and might not be entirely tested.

A README is present in each generator's folder.  
You can find the reference(s) I used to make the generator and a link to a codepen if you want to play around with it.
You will also find a link to a post explaining how I did it when it is written.

I intend to keep this repository as a future reference for when I will make a better looking (web) app containing all the generators.
